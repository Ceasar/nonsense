G'day, Bruce!
Oh, Hello Bruce!
How are you Bruce?
A bit crook, Bruce.
Where's Bruce?
He's not 'ere, Bruce.
Blimey, it's hot in here, Bruce.
Hot enough to boil a monkey's bum!
That's a strange expression, Bruce.
Well Bruce, I heard the Prime Minister use it. "It's hot enough to boil a monkey's bum in here, your Majesty," he said and she smiled quietly to herself.
She's a good Sheila Bruce, and not at all stuck up.
Here! Here's the boss-fellow now! - how are you Bruce?
Ow are you, Bruce?
G'day Bruce!
Bruce.
Hello Bruce.
Bruce.
How are you, Bruce?
